# Project Brutality Upgrades

This mod provides a menu to upgrade doomguy as he progresses into a megawad. Upgrades cost "Boom Bucks" which are earned for killing monsters and finding secrets. This mod is made specifically for Project Brutality and is not compatible with vanilla doom.

This mod was tested using [Project Brutality version 0.1.0A](https://github.com/pa1nki113r/Project_Brutality/releases/tag/0.1.0A) and GZDoom ^4.10.

The upgrade menu is bound to 'U' by default. That binding can be changed in the default config menu.

## Available Upgrades

- Increase Max Health
- Increase Max Ammo (individual ammo types)
- Damage Reduction
- Self Damage Reduction (Rocket & Grenade splash)
- Increase Damage dealt
- Increase Powerup duration
- Upgrade Berserk damage
- Health Regeneration
- Armor Regeneration

## Boom Bucks

Killing monsters rewards boom bucks; the amount rewarded depends on monster health.

- < 200 (zombiemen, imps) - 1 currency
- < 500 (demons, stronger imp variants) - 2 currency
- < 1000 (hell knights, revenants, mancubi) - 3 currency
- < 2000 (barons, archviles & stronger tier 3 variants) - 6 currency
- > 2000 (cyber demons & spider masterminds) - 10 currency

Finding a level secret adds 5 boom bucks, but only after the level is completed.
